# Reflections

## Estimates

I wouldn't say my estimates become more accurate overtime since they were off here and there a few
times. I noticed that when I have a busier week, I tend to underestimate the time possibly because
I was trying to finish everything as quick as possible. 

## Code Reviews

I noticed that everyone has different style of coding when I was doing code reviews. Even though 
we are following on the same materials, we always have different way of doing things. Also, I 
sometimes miss things in my code even if I'm being careful, so it's always good to have a second
perspective.

## Practical Tasks

The only real issue I have with the practicals is for GitHub. Commits, pushes and pull requests 
are explained alright but branches were really confusing. It took me awhile to understand what
branches look like (in the PyCharm interface) and how to do things with branches. It would be
great to have more detailed explanation for that. Another minor issue I have is with code reviews.
I believe I only received 2 PR mentions and 2 feedbacks for the last 5 practicals. I'm not quite 
sure if other students didn't mention me in their PRs or something went wrong and I didn't receive
the notifications.
