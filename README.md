There is a practical for every week, 10 in total. Each practical is stored in its own folder.

## About Author

Hello! My name is Hsu Myat Mon Win. I'm currently a postgraduate student at IT@JCU. I like everything to do with
software development, but programming is my favourite thing to do. I like solving puzzles and playing
video games in my free time.

## How do I keep my code clean?

Clean code improves readability of a program so that it is easy to understand and maintain. Here's a few things that I
do to keep my code clean.

- Always use meaningful variable names and comments. Especially in complex programs, having clear and concise
  description of the code (by using inline comments and docstrings) and easily recognizable variable names means you can
  maintain the code more efficiently.
- Always keep consistent formatting across the program. Having consistent code spacing and separating different logical
  sections of the code with empty lines will make the program more readable.
- Refer to PEP8 guidelines and static code analysis tool such as "pylint" to make sure your code is following
  the coding standards. Manually formatting the code can be very error-prone.
